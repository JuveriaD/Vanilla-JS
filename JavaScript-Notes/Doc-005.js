// LOOK FOR OPERATOR's CHART IN IMAGES FOLDER

//* javascript operators 

---- JavaScript Comparison Operators -----
//* (==) equal to
//* (===) equal value and equal type
//* (!=) not equal
//* (!==) not equal value or not equal type
//* (>) greater than
//* (<) less than
//* (>=) greater than or equal to
//* (<=) less than or equal to
//* (?) ternary operator



---- JavaScript Logical Operators ----
// &&	logical and
// ||	logical or
// !	logical not



---- Operators in JavaScript ----
// Operand - entities on which operators operate
// In 3 + 4 '+' is the operator and 3,4 are operand

 1. unary operator - It has single operand ( x = - x)
//* EXAMPLE OF UNARY OPERATOR
a = -a;
console.log(a);

 2. binary operator -  It has two operand ( x = x + 2)
//* EXAMPLE OF BINARY OPERATOR
a = 3 + 5;
console.log(a);

var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 3;

----- ARITHEMATIC OPERATORS in action in JavaScript ----
//? 1. addition
//? 2. subtraction
//? 3. multiplication
//? 4. division
//? 5. module
//? 6. to the power(raised to/ exponential operator)
//? 7. increment
//? 8. decrement

console.log("The  value of num1 + num2 is " + (num1 + num2));
console.log("The  value of num1 - num2 is " + (num1 - num2));
console.log("The  value of num1 * num2 is " + (num1 * num2));
console.log("The  value of num1 / num2 is " + (num1 / num2));
console.log("The  value of num1 % num2 is " + (num1 % num2));
console.log("The  value of num1 ** num2 is " + (num1 ** num2));
console.log("The  value of num1 ++ is " +( num1++));
console.log("The  value of num1 -- is " + (num1--));
console.log("The  value of ++num1  is " + (++num1));
console.log("The  value of --num1  is " + (--num1));


----- Operator Precedence ----
NOT (!) operator has higher precedence than AND (&&) and OR (||),
AND(&&) has higher precedence than OR (||)

    (!       &&      ||)

    Ex :
    let x=7;
    if(x==7 || x === 3 && x > 10)
     // True||(False && False)
    // True || (False) 
// Output : TRUE 
    {
        console.log("Higher precedence will execute first")
    }

// Note: MDN has a table chart of operators & their precedence
